# The Wordpress Converter for Jekyll
A delightful Java application hacked together in an afternoon that can take markdown files generated by [Exit WP](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp) and clean them up for deployment on a blog.

## Usage
For basic usage on a single file:

1. `mvn clean package`
2. `java -jar wpc.jar [filename.markdown]`

If you want to quickly process multiple files in a directory, you can drop this into a Bash script called `wpc.bash`:

    #!/bin/bash
    for FILE in "$@"; do
        echo "Parsing: $FILE"
        java -jar wpc.jar $FILE
    done
    
And then run the following line of Bash inside the directory your converted posts are in:

    find . -type f -name '*.markdown' -exec ./wpc.bash {} +
